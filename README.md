# golang-gorm-postgres
Email authincation back-End project
  Go project using gorm framework and postgres as a database.
  This project establishes database on postges and allows users to enter their email and create password for their account.
  After signing up, users will be able to login with their credintials.
  Also, I used token to verify every login for security reasons.
